### Hi 👋, I'm Denis Blinkov

Useful facts:

- ⭐️ Currently I'm working at [Rostelecom](https://www.company.rt.ru/en/) (Since 2022) as Python backend developer, and previously I worked at [Sber](https://www.sberbank.com/ru) and [Express messenger](https://express.ms/)
- 🦾 Having a ~2.5 years of experience, I am now switching to the Golang stack because I really like this language and want to develop highly loaded, scalable, robust systems that are built in Go rather than other programming languages.
- Have high passionate about and progressing in `Go`, `Backend development` and `Systems design`
- 🤖 I know a bunch about `Python`, `Javascript`, and I've tried many other programming languages and technologies (GameDev(unity), DS/ML, frontend development)
